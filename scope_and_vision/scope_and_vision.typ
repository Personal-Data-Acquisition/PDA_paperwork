= Abstract
The aim of this senior capstone project is to design and implement a versatile
data logging system that integrates single board computers (SBCs), STM32
microcontrollers, and the Rust programming language. The system will be capable
of collecting, storing, and processing data from various sensors and input
sources, providing a flexible and reliable solution for a wide range of
applications.  The project will involve the development of software for both
the SBCs and STM32 microcontrollers, leveraging the unique capabilities of each
platform. The Rust programming language will be used for its safety,
performance, and ease of use, allowing for efficient and reliable code
development.

+ Selection and integration of sensors and input devices for data
  collection.

+ Design and implementation of communication protocols between SBCs and
  STM32 microcontrollers.

+ Development of data processing algorithms and storage mechanisms.

+ Creation of a user interface for system configuration and data
  visualization.

The project will culminate in the deployment and testing of the data logging
system in real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness and
reliability. The system will be designed with scalability and modularity in
mind, allowing for future expansion and customization.  Overall, this project
aims to provide a comprehensive solution for data logging applications,
showcasing the capabilities of modern embedded systems and the Rust programming
language in real-world applications.

= Change Log

No changes were made to any of the project requirements since the first term;
we also haven't expanded the scope of the project as our team has been
plauged with non-functional, counterfit and cloned chips(micro-controllers, 
CAN transceivers).

#strong[DATE:] 2023-11-23

== Problem Description
Existing personal data acquisition devices are either too expensive or
too DIY for most potential users. Many are designed for aerospace,
automotive or research purposes, and are too expensive and unnecessarily
complicated for casual users. The only other option is for users to
build their own devices from prefabricated parts, which is too
complicated and requires too much much prerequisite knowledge for most
potential users.

=== Scope
The scope of this project is to develop a prototype for a personal data
acquisition device. This prototype will have the ability to collect real
time data from a variety of sensors, including accelerometers,
gyroscopes, GPS modules, and thermometers. These components will need to
combined in a printed circuit board for the final prototype. The scope
of this project also includes development of a web-based UI that both
presents the data gathered by the prototype and sends commands to the
physical device to record data and configure sensors.

=== Use Cases
The user will take the product along with them on an outdoor activity
and subject it to normal conditions for that activity.

The user will connect the product to a phone or laptop they brought with
them, and view the data stream and take samples using the user
interface, and save the data locally.

The user will choose and connect selected modules to the system using
the CAN(controller area network) bus.

== Purpose and Vision(Background)
Our purpose is to develop a personal data acquisition system that
records all the data a user might want, and is cheap and easy to set up
and use. It should be able to record data on acceleration, force,
position, etc. require minimal setup, and can be hooked up to bike,
go-kart, etc.

== Stakeholders
#strong[Capstone Team] \
The capstone team are the main decision makers for the project, and will
need extensive information for the product’s requirements and
implementation details. They will also need oversight from the project
partner and TA.

#strong[Project Partner] \
The project partner will be working very closely with the capstone team,
and will need to know the teams capabilities and status, and the status
of the project.

#strong[Project TA] \
The TA needs to be informed on project progress and any issues the team
may be having.

#strong[Capstone Instructors] \
The instructors require much of the same information as the TA, but
because they are working less closely with the team there is less
urgency.

#strong[Users] \
Users will need to know the product’s capabilities, limitations and
intended use.

== Preliminary Context
=== Assumptions
- We have a suitable power supply of 12v to power the system.

- The end user has a device capable of connecting to an ad-hoc network.

- The data to be logged doesn’t require more speed than the CAN 2.0
  standard.

- The environment it’s meant to be used in is electrically noisy.

=== Constraints
- As undergraduate students, our team has limited experience in the
  field, so we will have to learn a lot to deliver the product.

- Our budget is limited, so we will have to choose components carefully
  based on price.

- We are limited to three terms to deliver our product.

With these constraints factored, the biggest concerns for the
feasibility of our project are the skills that need to be learned and
limited time alloted to do so and complete the project. As an example,
the team has primarily non-formal experience in hardware organization
but has thus far worked efficiently in that aspect of the project. These
risks are mitigated by the expertise and technical support offered by
our project partner, and we consequently find the scope of our project
realistic.

=== Dependencies
- The rust language, (reduces bugs and helps with memory safety.)

- C compiler(s), (C ABI is still used as a way to interface with libs.)

- Rust Embassy Library. (Embedded rust lib to reduce boilerplate)

- Rust Rocket(web server)

- STM SDK and HAL (Good refences for the actual hardware.)

- The CAN standard.

- The Unix networking stack

- SQLite and or rust file I/O

- Rust Libraries available for individual sensor modules.

Some possible bottlenecks that could occur given our current dependencies would
be centered around sensor modules not having an existing library written in
rust. This would add more development time to the project.  However, we’ve
researched workarounds and discovered tools to generate the needed interfaces
for rust from a C header file.

== Market Assessment and Competition Analysis
#strong[RexGen:] Proprietary CAN bus based data logger, hard to find tutorial
or documentation and is prohibitively expensive for hobbyists. Also unable to
guarantee that their system is memory safe.

#strong[CANedge1:] CANedge1: It has open source elements to it and
documentation that is accessible, but still does not meet the requirements for
its cost.  DEWEsoft sells test and measurement equipment. Their products are
not a good fit for our users because they are designed for industry, and
therefore overkill and are prohibitively expensive for an individual.  Omega
Engineering sells data loggers that can record the data our users would want,
can connect to a remote device over Bluetooth and have easy to use interfaces.
However most of their data loggers only record one or two types of data, so a
user would need to buy many of them, which would be inconvenient and expensive.
An Apple Watch can track a user’s activity data, and send it to an iPhone with
an easy to read interface. However, the Apple Watch is limited in what kind of
data it can record, and would not be appropriate for our users due to its many
other unneeded functions.  There are guides on the internet that instruct a
user on how to build their own data acquisition device using Arduino or
Raspberry Pi microcontroller much more inexpensively than the other
alternatives. However, this requires the user to have background knowledge in
circuitry and programming, and requires a lot of time and effort to set up.

== Target Demographics (User Persona)
Terry is an amateur Go-kart enthusiast who was brought into the hobby 8 months
ago by friends and has become entrenched in the hobby since then. They are
looking for a way to improve their performance but need more information about
their current racing habits to do that.  Alice is a CTO of a large company that
has decided to data log the forces and location their products experience
during shipping through multiple contracted pilots and routes. She needs a
system that isn’t cost prohibitive to deploy in large numbers and can be
customized for her company’s other projects as needed.  John is an extreme
snowboarder looking to collect data from his downhill tricks in order to help
his friend create realistic and smooth animations for a snowboarding video
game. He needs a data logging system that can endure cold environments and is
modular so he can keep down the bulk/weight of the system while carving toeside
and hitting some sweet jumps.  James is a competition mountain biker who wants
to record and analyze data during rides for performance improvement. Uses a
smartphone and needs an easy-to-use interface. He needs a system to compare
data between runs.

=== User Documentation
The user documentation will be produced in markdown or LaTeX into a PDF
or webpage. This documentation will cover the basic usage of the system
and instructions on how to build it.

=== Testing and Quality Assurance
Testing will be done through TDD(test driven development) using the
supported testing frameworks for rust and C. These tests will allow us
as developers to ensure the assumptions we make about our code matches
the actual behavior of it.

Quality assurance will mostly be handled by adhearance to style
standards enforced by the lanuages LSP(language server protocol)
servers. The two that will see extensive use in this project being:

+ Rust-analyzer
+ clangd

Bug and issue tracking will all be handled by GitHub’s Issue and project

= Software Design and Architecture Document (SDA)
#strong[Authors:] Jake Goodwin, Aidan Agee, Blake Babb, Patrick Iacob

#strong[DATE:] 2023-12-03

== Introduction
This document establishes the software and hardware architecture for a
personal data acquisition system. Selecting the correct architecture
improves development velocity and enables more robust functionality by
having systems that support each other. Cohesive Software Architecture
is particularly important for this project as our workflow has
contributors split into two sub teams which are developing a frontend
and backend that must communicate. In addition to that, designing an
appropriate hardware architecture will reduce development costs and help
our product find its place in the market.

== Architectural Goals and Principles
Our hardware and software architectures have the primary goal of being
synergistic with each other and possessing libraries that interface with
each other.

Because our project covers layers ranging from hardware to a website,
connection throughout the stack is critical. Additionally, as we work
through the prototyping stage our architecture will practice modularity
to be able to add new sensor hardware as we expand the capabilities of
the product. Our architecture does not need to prioritize scalability as
the final objective is only to develop a prototype.

== System Overview
#figure([#box(width: 300.0pt, image("SystemOverview.png"));],
  caption: [
    image
  ]
)

== Architectural Patterns
Controller Responder: This pattern is useful as our hardware SBC can act
as the controller which has a single responder in the user webpage. This
pattern would help cache data generated by the controller to provide a
seamless experience to the user in the face of latency issues.
Additionally, the ability to access data in the responder without
affecting the controller will allow for computation in an environment
separate from the hardware board.

Event Sourcing: This pattern works especially well with real-time data,
which is what this project is all about. Our hardware controller can act
as the producer and broadcast its data to a web server which will act as
the event source for an y users that want to query the server and
consume that data. The fail-safety of this design is also important to
this project as data acquisition environments, such as racing or
aeronautics, often cause damage to the controller while still requiring
data to be accessible.

== Component Descriptions
#strong[Sensors:] Hardware components that acquire the raw data, such as
accelerometers o r GPS devices.

#strong[Microcontroller:] Small computer that is responsible for
coordinating the sensors and collecting their data to be broadcast to
the web server.

#strong[Web server:] Acts as the intermediary between the user and the
physical acquisition device. Communicates with the board, composed of
the microcontroller and its sensors, to collect data which it then
relays to the user interface when queried.

#strong[User interface:] An HTTP webpage that requests data from the web
server to present in useful ways to the user.

== Data Management
Sensor readings are transmitted over canbus in JSON format. Data is
stored in a relational database on the Raspberry Pi. RESTful API
endpoints are provided for CRUD operations on data.

== Interface Definitions
There will be a user interface to collect data from each sensor and
display it to the user. There will be interactions to get event logs
from each sensor, and to clear the event logs. The user interface will
be hosted on a web server, which users will connect to over with their
browser over HTTP.

API endpoints for the web interface include:

- `GET /data`: Returns a list of collected data from personal devices. \
- `GET /sensors`: Returns a list of sensor configurations. \
- `POST /data`: Allows the addition of new data. \
- `PUT /data/{id}`: Updates data with a specified ID. \
- `PUT /sensors/{id}`: Configure a sensor with a specific ID. \
- `DELETE /data/{id}`: Deletes data with a specified ID.

== Considerations
=== Security
The primary data security risk in this project is data loss due to
physical conditions of the board. This includes both permanent damage
through the elements or impacts as well as location preventing broadcast
to the web server. A caching system on both the board and in the web
server is the approach that will be used to mitigate this risk.

The data security risks due to bad actors in this project are minimal as
the data being processed is kinematic information. Regardless, our web
server will require password authentication to access the RSA encrypted
data.

=== Performance
There are two primary performance concerns of the product. The first is
the resolution of our data and how quickly we can poll our sensors, for
which the current target is acquiring 10 data points per second. We plan
to achieve this metric by screening hardware before they are implemented
into the design to ensure it can meet this desired performance. The
second concern is with the stability of the connection between the user
interface and the board’s raw data. We plan to create a web server that
will be able to cache the data produced by the board and present to the
user at will to mitigate this concern.

=== Maintenance and Support
Once the prototype is complete, maintenance and development will be
inherited by Patton Dynamics, the company partner for this project. The
company has a background in aeronautics, competitive motor racing, and
computer assisted physics, all of which are relevant to the project
area. Their experience with the common end users of personal data
acquisition devices makes them very capable of supporting users through
the life cycle of the product.

== Deployment Strategy
As the ultimate objective for this project is to develop a prototype PCB
that hosts a local webserver as a user interface, there is only
deployment in a development environment.

== Testing Strategy
=== Software (SBC side) Testing
User testing will be done to ensure users can understand and use the
interface effectively. These tests should be focused on confirming that
functional requirements are met.

Integration testing will be done with mock data until microcontrollers
and sensors are operational. Further tests will be conducted when
hardware is more complete.

=== Firmware Testing
Our firmware testing methodology will make heavy usage of mocks for many
of the hardware components so we tests can be run on development
machines instead of on the embedded systems.

A Red Green refactoring/testing cycle will ensure we always know the
tests we write are both useful and logically possible to fail. Writing
any tests that cannot fail would end up being dead or uncalled code.

Many of the usual tests that would be prevalent for ensuring good memory
management will be unnecessary from our use of the rust language. This
along with the built in `rust-docs` will allow us to even use our tests
as examples where needed as part of our documentation.

Integration testing will mostly be handled as mocked interfaces
replicating the physical hardware that will be required to collect the
data. Further tests can added as needed should more sensors be added to
the project at a later point in time.

#strong[DATE:] 2023-11-16

= Principles
- We will respond to asynchronous communication within 24 hours
- We will be at meetings on time and pay attention
- All changes need to be isolated to their own git branch
- Each work item need a corresponding GitHub issue
- Pull Requests have to be reviewed by at least one team member
- We will use a kanban board to continuously work on the backlog
- Once a work item is complete, a pull request is created
- Blocks need to be discussed as soon as possible

= Process
Task Selection: \* Kanban style \* Select highest priority item within
your role’s domain

To Solve an Issue and Meet Acceptance Criteria: 1. Write failing tests.
2. Write code to pass tests. 3. Repeat. 4. Open a pull-request and merge

== Steps in software development

)

These are the general outlines for the four different roles in the
project. We have a verbal agreement at the moment that we will help out
with parts of the project outside our roles as needed.

= Tooling

)]
)

== Version Control
Git will allow our team to track changes in the projects files over
time. Also prevents the loss of work from hardware failures.

== Project Management
GitHub projects is integrated into github organizations as well as git.
The project management software makes the collaboration between
developers easy and will make tracking milestones and issues for the
entire project across multiple repositories a possibility.

== Documentation
Documentation will primaily be done through the built-in rust-docs
feature. This is accesiable via the CLI(command line interface) tooling.
This will encapsulate how the code itself and any interfaces are
documented.

Because the documentation is genreated as part of the code this will
ensure that up to date and accurate documentatio is always availble.

Secondary documentation meant for non-developers will be done using a
combination of markdown and LaTex where needed. This will be availble
usally in a PDF format.

== Schematics & PCB
The KiCAD program gives access to the schematics and PCB designs to all
team members due to the software begin free and open-source.

It will allow us to comment, label and design the needed circuits for
the physical hardware of the system; providing a good troubleshooting
resource as well.

== Communication
#strong[Discord:] \* Used to coordinate team meetings. \* To share
ideas/brainstorm \* give updates on project.

#strong[Teams:] \* TA meetings.

#strong[GITHUB:] \* To discuss project issues. \* share documentation.

= Definition of Done(DOD)
- Acceptance criteria all satisfied by code changes
- Changes have been merged to master after completing the Pull Request
  Process
- A completed Pull Request has at least one approval and no marks for
  "Needs Work"
- All tests pass with changes implemented and no reversion is required
- Relevant documentation for the feature has been updated
- Discussion points are prepared for next meeting

== TESTING
#strong[Rust:]

The testing for all code repositories will be done using a testing
harness or framework. For rust this takes the form of the `cargo test`
command, which is part of the package managment system(tool-chain).

These tests will be used as one of acceptance critera for a branch to be
pulled into the main branch.

#strong[C:]

Some libraries or areas where the use of C code is needed we plan to use
cmocka as the unit testing framework. This combined with Cmake as the
build system will give us a host agnostic development cycle.

=== Quality Assurance
Quality assurance will mostly be handled by adhearance to style
standards enforced by the lanuages LSP(language server protocol)
servers. The two that will see extensive use in this project being:

+ Rust-analyzer
+ clangd

=== Feedback
Feedback on the work done will take place in the github projects. The
issues and discussion boards are the main locations for this, with the
weekly meetings and discord being a secondary and informal medium for
minor feedback.

= Release Cycle
For the moment we will used semantic versioning with the standard
Major.minor.patch format. This will help when it comes to dealing with
any major changes that break APIs.

== Contingency Plans
Feedback can be shared during weekly standup with the TA, or over
Discord if they are more time-sensitive, after which it should be
reviewed by the whole team, and then incorporated. Changes to the whole
process will require more comprehensive feedback and approval from the
team before going into effect, after which related documents should be
modified as soon as possible.

In the event of unexpected challenges, the team should be notified
immediately, and if serious enough should be brought up with the TA,
project partner or instructor, otherwise they should be brought up
during regular meetings.

= Timeline
- 12/15/2023: Version 0 complete with breadboard organized hardware and
  visual UI elements
