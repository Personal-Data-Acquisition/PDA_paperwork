#label("hale-stanley-calvin")
prototype car and audio engine.

commented out code/debug statments in the code on line 31,36 could be
cleaned up a bit.

Using rust, so that’s really cool.

It’s using a entity componet system?

Code seperation is nice, and I can see he’s put a lot of work into
breaking code into smaller sized functions.

audio changing based on the locatino for both audio channels.

Possibility of doppler effect? Compression the soundwaves for approch
and lowering the pitch as it moves away?

Q: what is the game engine? Bevy?

#label("giamakidis-yannis")
Creation of AI for game zomebies.

-  enemy movement & chase functionality
-  using ai tools in URE5
-  always chase AI.
-  patrolling AI.
-  Nexus AI.

Code and control flow? The way URE5 works is interesting but I won’t lie
I don’t totally understand the strange graphs being used to control it.

Eventgraphs seem interesting but I’m not sure what the code looks like
behind the scenes.
