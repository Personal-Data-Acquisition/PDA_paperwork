The Data Logger developed as part of this capstone project
uses the common STM32F1 series of microcontrollers integrated with a
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus and implemented using Embedded Rust.
Sensor capabilities include GPS, acceleration, temperature, and more.
The data gathered by this device can be viewed through a custom web UI
hosted by the device.This system represents a robust solution for real-time
data acquisition, processing, and storage, catering to diverse industrial
and automotive applications.
